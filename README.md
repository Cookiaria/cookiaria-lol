# OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA
yes, im naming this that

stupid project ive started on an electron app that had access to dev tools and editing the html like that which later became this ; an actual website to host this thing because holy shit why do i not have access to notepad

im still mad about that but i think this thing is way better anyway

### ⚠️ disclamer:

- this does not store anything anywhere except your pc with localstorage, if you clear site data and cookies, your saved notes will be gone

- i cannot guarantee that it will actually save so dont get mad at me if it doesn't

# FEATURES:
- REALTIME MARKDOWN
- autosaving every second
- creatures
- TAB CREATION!
- TAB RENAMING! (right click them)
- garb

# known issues atm:
- preview button not working at ALL (i will fix i promise)
- autosave not working if you type, not create another tab and switch, then refresh
- some css colors being all over the place for now
- mobile does not look right (i will not fix this since this is not intended for mobile anyway)

# CHANGELOG:
### v6 - Feb 13, 2025
- CREATURE PICKER
  - you can now right click on the creature randomizer and choose your creature manually, it does not save still
  - creature picker has been moved from the top right to the bottom left
- more creatures! + credits
- COMMAND BAR
  - accessable with `CTRL` + `ALT` + `Q`
  - only commands so far are `export`, `import`, and `help`, will transfer "begone" to this system once i have time
- EXPORT AND IMPORT FEATURE (command bar only)
- made a helper script to automatically read from /assets/creatures and apply to creatures.txt if you somehow wanna fork this and add or delete creatures yourself and make the process faster (you need python)
- added info for wildcards that modify creature styles on creatures.txt
- fixed an issue where if you renamed a tab "begone" while only one tab, it wouldnt delete its contents
- a few easter eggs
- preview hides the creature for now until i figure something out

### v5 - Feb 9, 2025
- tabs can now be deleted and added
- added the ability to rename tabs by right clicking them
- when renaming a tab "begone", it factory resets everything with no return (why did i do 
this)
- added a random creature button

### v4 - Feb 7, 2025
- tabs ‼️‼️
- RANDOM CREATURES!
- AUTOSAVE

### v3.1 - Feb 6, 2025
- MIT license

### v3 - Feb 4, 2025
- attempt to make the preview also have the creature (epic fail)
- scrollbar fix attempt (it was ass)
- not an ultrakill reference anymore ... unless ... 

### v2 - Jan 29, 2025
- made assets point to /assets/thing instead of notes.cookiaria.lol/assets/thing or an old repo (i know im stupid)
- added favicon
- ultrakill reference

### v1 - Jan 28, 2025
- initial release
- creature "watermark"
- trying to make the height actually the same as the browser window
- ultrakill reference

## wtf does otorrinolaringologia mean ⁉️
stupid word a workmate and i came up with while he was watching me fuck around with html

i might give it another name probably perhaps until i think of something funnier
