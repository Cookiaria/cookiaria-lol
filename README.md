# OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA
yes, im naming this that

stupid project ive started on an electron app that had access to dev tools and editing the html like that which later became this ; an actual website to host this thing because holy shit why do i not have access to notepad

im still mad about that but i think this thing is way better anyway

### ⚠️ disclamer:

- this does not store anything anywhere except your pc with localstorage, if you clear site data and cookies, your saved notes will be gone

- i cannot guarantee that it will actually save so dont get mad at me if it doesn't

## FEATURES:
- REALTIME MARKDOWN
- autosaving every second
- creatures
- TAB CREATION!
- TAB RENAMING! (right click them)
- garb

## known issues atm:
- preview button not working at ALL (i will fix i promise)
- autosave not working if you type, not create another tab and switch, then refresh
- some css colors being all over the place for now
- mobile does not look right (i will not fix this since this is not intended for mobile anyway)
