# OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA
yes, im naming this that

stupid project ive started on an electron app that had access to dev tools and editing the html like that which later became this ; an actual website to host this thing because holy shit why do i not have access to notepad

im still mad about that but i think this thing is way better anyway

## wtf does otorrinolaringologia mean
stupid word a classmate and i came up with while he was watching me fuck around in html

## issues atm:
- preview button not working at ALL (i will fix i promise)
- some css colors being all over the place for now
- mobile does not look right (i will not fix this since this is not intended for mobile anyway)
